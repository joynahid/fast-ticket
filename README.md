```bash
# Book the first available trip
python main.py

# Book a specific trip number
python main.py --trip 2

# Refresh cache and book
python main.py --refresh

python main.py --from-city "Dhaka" --to-city "Chittagong" --journey-date "28-May-2025"
```

### CLI Options

## Architecture

The application follows clean architecture principles with three main layers:

1. **Application Layer**: Orchestrates the business logic and coordinates between different services
2. **Business Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain rules
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external systems and implementations
